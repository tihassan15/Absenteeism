# Absenteeism
SQL queries for healthy and low absenteesim employees along with the compensation rate increase for non-smokers.
## Summary
In this project I explored absenteeism at an organization and gained key insights that indicate with whom and when absenteeism had the highest occurrence. I began by providing a list of healthy and low absenteeism employees using SQL, so they can be rewarded in a bonus program. Also, I calculated the compensation rate increase that non-smokers will be given. Next, I created a dashboard in Tableau to visualize absenteeism insights.
